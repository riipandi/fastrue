<hr/>

Headless authentication server for securing your apps, inspired by Netlify GoTrue, but built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

> **WARNING!** This project still in development.
> Everything is experimental, breaking changes can happen and the long-term purpose of this project is not yet clear, use at your own risk!

## üèÅ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

The following are required to run the application in development or in production environment:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) v1.66 or greater.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) PostgreSQL server v14 or greater.
- [sqlx](https://crates.io/crates/sqlx) for interacting with the database.
- [sqlx-cli](https://crates.io/crates/sqlx-cli) a command line tool for sqlx.
- [cargo watch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch), a tool for watching the project files and recompiling when they change.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install), v2.10 or greater. This is optional, only required when building container image.

### Generate Secret Key

Before you continue, you need to create `.env` file (you can duplicate `.env.example`) and
fill the `application secret key` with some random string. To generate a secret key, use
the following command:

```sh
cargo run -- generate-secret
```

### Up and Running

```sh
make dev             # run in development
make build           # build binary file
make docker-build    # build docker container
make docker-run      # run the docker container
```

Application will run at `http://localhost:9999`

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Development

To run the application in development mode, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Change the `TRUSTY_SECRET_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` variables value.
4. Run `sqlx database create` to create the database from the specified `DATABASE_URL`
5. Run `sqlx migrate run` to run the migrations
6. use `sqlx migrate add -r <migration_name>` to add a new migration

**Note**: Use `sqlx database drop` to revert the change

## üöÄ Deployment
