## Introduction

Fastrue is a fast and robust authentication library for Fastify, inspired by Supabase GoTrue
(originally from Netlify GoTrue).

#### Notes

- HTTP 5XX errors are not listed for each endpoint. These should be handled globally. Not all HTTP 5XX errors are generated from Fastrue, and they may serve non-JSON content. Make sure you inspect the Content-Type header before parsing as JSON.
- Error responses are somewhat inconsistent. Avoid using the msg and HTTP status code to identify errors. HTTP 400 and 422 are used interchangeably in many APIs.
- If the server has CAPTCHA protection enabled, the verification token should be included in the request body.
- Rate limit errors are consistently raised with the HTTP 429 code.
- Enums are used only in request bodies / parameters and not in responses to ensure wide compatibility with code generators that fail to include an unknown enum case.

#### Backward compatibility:

- Endpoints marked as Experimental may change without notice.
- Endpoints marked as Deprecated will be supported for at least 3 months since being marked as deprecated.
- HTTP status codes like 400, 404, 422 may change for the same underlying error condition.
